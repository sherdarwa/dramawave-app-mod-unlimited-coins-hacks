DramaWave Mod unlimited coins Free VIP unlocked Hacks guide - There is a table near the exit with a walkie talkie. If you use a walkie talkie, you will seek help from J to obtain the pink bottle. He will ask you some questions about the appearance of the bottle, and you will receive three answers. To describe the shape of the bottle, please select 'cylindrical'; When asked about hats, choose 'Plan'; When asked about labels, choose "Hand drawn 8". Next, pick up the plasma gun and leave the safe room. Keep walking forward until you reach a place with a ladder. Go down and return to the kitchen, where the robot Marty is. Find the green dishwashing liquid bottle and take it away. However, you will keep the gun, so remember where it is so that you can retrieve it later. DramaWave app latest updated
